> There are two ways of constructing software - one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. — Tony Hoare

This article discusses the pros and cons of Moltbot, a recently launched tool. What I find particularly interesting is that this tool reflects some of the software design principles we've explored in class. Clearly, Moltbot resembles the latter case in Hoare's quote. Built on top of already mature LLM services, it tells an almost perfect story — for just $5 a month, you can have an assistant like Jarvis from the sci-fi movies, one that can almost fully automate tasks for you. Yet behind this sci-fi fantasy lies the reality of exposing your sensitive information to an AI system full of uncertainties, while many of its configurations require no technical expertise to set up. This is a form of hidden complexity: users think they're secure when they're not.
